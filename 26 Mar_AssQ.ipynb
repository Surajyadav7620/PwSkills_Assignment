    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (response variable) and an independent variable (predictor variable). It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be approximated by a straight line. The goal of simple linear regression is to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Let's say we want to examine the relationship between the number of hours studied (independent variable) and the exam score achieved (dependent variable) by a group of students. We collect data from 30 students, recording the number of hours they studied and their corresponding exam scores. Using simple linear regression, we can determine how much the exam score is expected to increase for each additional hour of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression extends the concept of simple linear regression by considering multiple independent variables to predict a dependent variable. Instead of a single predictor variable, it involves a linear combination of two or more predictor variables to model the relationship with the dependent variable. The goal is still to find the best-fit line, but in multiple linear regression, the line becomes a hyperplane in a higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Suppose we want to predict the price of a house (dependent variable) based on its size in square feet (independent variable) and the number of bedrooms (another independent variable). We gather data on 100 houses, including their sizes, number of bedrooms, and corresponding prices. By using multiple linear regression, we can develop a model that takes both the size and number of bedrooms into account to estimate the price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, simple linear regression deals with a single independent variable, while multiple linear regression incorporates two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable."

    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable is additive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. There should be no correlation or dependence between the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be consistent throughout the range of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) follow a normal distribution. This assumption is important to ensure accurate inference and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Multicollinearity: There should be no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables, meaning that the predictor variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following diagnostic tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Analysis: Examine the residuals to check for linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality. Plotting the residuals against the predicted values and the independent variables can help identify patterns or deviations from these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality Test: You can use statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or visual methods like a histogram or Q-Q plot to assess the normality of the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: Calculate the correlation matrix of the independent variables to identify high correlations. Additionally, variance inflation factor (VIF) can be computed for each predictor to quantify the extent of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Durbin-Watson Test: This test checks for the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals, which violates the independence assumption. A value close to 2 suggests no autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cook's Distance: This measure helps identify influential data points that may significantly affect the regression results. Points with high Cook's distance may indicate leverage or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By conducting these tests and analyzing the results, you can assess whether the assumptions of linear regression hold in your dataset. If any assumptions are violated, appropriate remedial measures or alternative modeling techniques may be required."

    "\n",
    "The intercept (often denoted as \"b\" or \"intercept term\") represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. It determines the point where the regression line intersects the y-axis. The intercept captures the baseline value of the dependent variable when there is no influence from the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope (often denoted as \"m\" or \"coefficients\") represents the change in the dependent variable (y) for each unit change in the independent variable (x).

    "Suppose we want to predict house prices based on their sizes (in square feet). We collect data on house sizes and their corresponding prices. We fit a linear regression model to the data and obtain the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Price = 100,000 + 50 * Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercept (100,000): The intercept suggests that even if a house has a size of zero square feet, it still has an estimated price of $100,000. This accounts for the baseline value or fixed cost component that contributes to the house price, such as land value or other factors not related to size.\n",
    "Slope (50): The slope indicates that for each additional square foot in size, the house price is estimated to increase by $50. This suggests a positive linear relationship between house size and price. As the size of the house increases, the price is expected to increase by $50 per square foot.\n",
    "For example, if we have a house with a size of 1,500 square feet:\n",

    "According to the linear regression model, the estimated price for a house with a size of 1,500 square feet would be $175,000.\n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the optimal values of parameters or coefficients that minimize a given cost or loss function. It is commonly employed in training models, particularly in cases where the number of parameters is large.\n",

The goal is to find the set of parameter values that minimize the cost function and improve the performance of the model.\n",

It enables the models to learn from data and adjust their parameters to fit the training data better, leading to improved prediction accuracy.\n",

    "Overfitting risk: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the complexity of the model also increases.
